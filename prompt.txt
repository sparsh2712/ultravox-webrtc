#KNOWLEDGE BASE
## why_mosaic

**Question variants**  
- Why do you call it Mosaic?  
- What does the name Mosaic mean?  

**Short answer**  
Because our portfolio is built like a mosaic: many specialised pieces combined into one coherent picture of risk-controlled yield.  

**Follow-up**  
Would you like the full story behind the name and philosophy?  

**Long answer**  
We bring together multiple hyper-competences—structured finance, real-estate credit, specialty NBFC lending—under a single disciplined framework. Just as small tiles create a larger image, security-level limits (≤ 5 % each) and sector caps (20–30 %) create a genuinely diversified whole.

Sophisticated investors (min Rupees 1 crore) who want higher fixed-income returns and can stay for ~5 years.

## performing_credit

**Question variants**  
- What is performing credit?  
- Explain your asset class  

**Short answer**  
Loans to companies already meeting obligations—no distress, no venture risk.  

**Follow-up**  
Want to see how this differs from distress or special-situations funds?  

**Long answer**  
“Performing” means:  
- Zero past defaults  
- Solid leverage and coverage  
- Hard collateral and escrowed cash flows  

Distress funds buy impaired loans at a discount; special situations occupy the grey middle. Our mandate bars both.

## risk_controls

**Question variants**  
- How are you minimising risk?  
- What makes the portfolio safe?  

**Short answer**  
Diversification + granularity: 25–30 secured positions, none > 5 % of AUM; sector caps 20–30 %; CIO-led risk veto.  

**Follow-up**  
Would you like examples of stress testing and default maths?  

**Long answer**  
By spacing exposure across financials, operating corporates and real estate, plus tight single-name limits, we contain idiosyncratic and cluster risk.  
**Stress math:**  
- 10 % default, 50 % recovery → IRR −1.5 pp to 11.5 %.  
- 30 % default → ~8 % IRR (still above bank FDs).  
Historical default rate for Indian BBB/A portfolios: ~3 % over the last decade.

---

## expected_returns

**Question variants**  
- What returns can I expect?  
- Is 13–14 % reasonable?  

**Short answer**  
Target 13–14 % net IRR before tax—5–7 pp above sovereign yields, lower volatility than equities.  

**Follow-up**  
Shall I break down coupons, capital gains and post-tax numbers?  

**Long answer**  
- Coupons of 9–10 % distributed quarterly; residual gains accrue at maturity.  
- Interest taxed at your slab; capital gains at applicable rates—guidance suggests ~10 % post-tax for 30 % bracket. Verify with your CA.

---

## compare_fd

**Question variants**  
- How does this compare to an FD?  
- Why not stick to bank deposits?  

**Short answer**  
~5–6 pp uplift over FDs, with diversification mitigating risk—but not principal-guaranteed.  

**Follow-up**  
Want numbers on how defaults impact returns?  

**Long answer**  
Example (rupees 100 portfolio):  
- 10 % default, 50 % recovery → −rupees 5 loss; ~1.5 pp drag → 11.5 % IRR  
- 30 % default → ~8 % IRR  
FDs offer certainty but cap upside.

---

## liquidity

**Question variants**

- Can I exit early?  

**Short answer**  
Close-ended—no daily redemptions. We facilitate secondary sales or NBFC loans-against-units up to ~50 %.  

**Follow-up**  
Need details on draw-down and repayment schedule?  

**Long answer**  
- First 25 % call: June 2025; remainder within 4 months.

## nbfc_slice

**Question variants**  
- Why include NBFCs?  
- Aren’t NBFCs risky now?  

**Short answer**  
We lend only to retail-focused, profitable NBFCs (CAR > 20 %, leverage < 3.5×) to capture spreads banks cannot.  

**Follow-up**  
Want context on 2018 vs today?  

**Long answer**  
Post-ILFS reforms NBFCs have better liquidity (LTRO, RBI lines), balanced ALM, lower wholesale exposure. Easing monetary stance, stronger real-estate collateral, wider spreads = opportunity with controlled downside. We cap unsecured exposure and monitor monthly collections.

---

## real_estate_slice

**Question variants**  
- Why real-estate finance?  
- Isn’t RE risky?  

**Short answer**  
Mid-income housing (1–5 lakh sq ft) sells in 3–4 years; approval-stage loans yield 17–19 % with escrowed cash-flows.  

**Follow-up**  
Need more on RERA safeguards and collateral covers?  

**Long answer**  
- RERA: 70 % buyer advances in escrow for construction/lenders.  
- ≥2× cover (land + cash-flows); developers must have ≥3 prior financings.  
- Low inventory (15 months supply, lowest since 2014); >20 % price uptick since 2021.

---

## taxation

**Question variants**  
- How is the fund taxed?  
- What taxes do I pay?  

**Short answer**  
Pass-through AIF: we deduct TDS; you pay slab-rate on interest + capital-gains tax on appreciation.  

**Follow-up**  
Need an illustration of effective post-tax yield?  

**Long answer**  
Example (30 % bracket):  
- Coupon 14 % taxed at 30 % → 10 % net  
- Some gains taxed as capital gains (~2–3 pp advantage)  
*Confirm with your CA; rules vary.*

## investment_process

**Question variants**  
- What’s the minimum ticket?  
- Smallest investment allowed?

rupees 1 crore (rupees 25 lakh for accredited investors).  

**Follow-up**  
Need to know why SEBI sets this threshold?

## comparison_other_funds

**Question variants**  
- How are you different from other credit funds?  
- What’s your edge?  

**Short answer**  
Three edges: multi-sector diversification, in-house origination > 50 %, exit-focused risk culture.  

**Follow-up**  
Would you like concrete examples?  

**Long answer**  
- **Diversification:** most peers single-sector.  
- **Origination:** senior teams source directly, saving 1–2 % banker fees.  
- **Risk culture:** prefer early exits over “work-out” bets (2000, 2008, 2015, 2020 cycles).

---

## macro_timing

**Question variants**  
- Is now a good time for credit?  
- What does the macro say?  

**Short answer**  
Leverage, NPAs and credit costs at 15-year lows; upgrades outpace downgrades 1.8:1—favourable for credit.

- NPA ratio: 1 % vs 6 % in 2018; banking credit cost: 50 bps.  
- CRISIL 3-year A→D transition: 1 % (half pre-IBC average).  
These fundamentals typically hold 3–4 years, smoothing credit over equity downturns.

---

## fd_versus_risk

**Question variants**  
- Could I lose money like in equities?  
- What if defaults spike?  

**Short answer**  
Credit risk is about survival, not growth. Diversified portfolios see gradual drawdowns—unlike equity swings.  

**Follow-up**  
Need the default-IRR table?  

**Long answer**  
Default / Recovery / Net IRR (5-year):  
- 10 % / 50 % → 11.5 %  
- 20 % / 50 % → 10 %  
- 30 % / 50 % → 8 %  
Even severe cases exceed typical FD rates. Consult your adviser.

## fees_and_carry

**Question variants**
- What are the fees?
- What is the expense ratio?
- What is the carry?

**Short answer**
Expense ratio is 1% to 1.5% per annum, among the industry's lowest. There is a 10% hurdle rate, and 15% of the excess return above that hurdle rate is charged as "carry."

**Follow-up**
Would you like a detailed breakdown of how the fees and carry are calculated?

**Long answer**
The expense ratio covers the fund's operational costs and is charged annually. The "carry" is a performance-based fee, only applied if the fund exceeds a 10% hurdle rate. 15% of any returns above this hurdle are allocated as carry. This aligns our interests with yours, ensuring we only benefit when you do.
