## INVESTMENT STRATEGY

### Performing Credit Definition
- Performing credit (PC) is often synonymous with structured credit, a subset of private debt
- Refers to credit that is not distressed, not a new venture, and does not require turnaround for repayment
- Firms expected to return capital assuming similar conditions persist over next few years

### Portfolio Allocation
- **Financials (20-30%)**: Mid-sized NBFCs with yields of 12-14%, secured by underlying loans
- **Corporate Finance (40-60%)**: Capital market-related exposures with collateral of assets or promoter shares, yields 14-16%
- **Developer Finance (near 20%)**: Residential projects in top 3 cities, yields 16-19%, with >2x cover of land, project assets, and cash flows
- **Deal sizes**: Rs. 20-25 cr for financials, Rs. 25-40 cr for real estate, Rs. 20-40 cr for structured finance

### Investment Criteria
- **Financial Health**: Manageable leverage, strong coverage ratios, competitive margins
- **Security**: Tangible, enforceable collateral (no shared collateral)
- **Cash Flow**: Facilities must be supported by cash flows rather than relying solely on collateral
- **External Environment**: Favorable credit conditions from perspectives of competition, group financial strength, policy, and geopolitics

### Exclusions
- Firms and industries competing with China
- Firms in significant capex cycles, those facing intense competition, or heavily reliant on state government receivables
- Non-bankable assets or areas where banks won't lend
- Venture debt or distressed investments

### Deal Making Capabilities
- Investment research and risk team of over 10 members
- **Real Estate**: Concluded 250+ transactions with 140 builders over the past decade
- **Financials**: Managed ₹10,000 crore of mid-sized NBFC books
- **Structured Finance**: Managed portfolios worth ₹20,000 crore
- Anticipate originating at least 50% of trades directly
- Sources include relationships, funds (onshore/offshore), consulting firms, Big4, boutique investment banks (O3, Spark, I-Sec, etc.), smaller advisors, and banks

## SECTORAL STRATEGIES

### 1. Structured Finance
- At least 50% of portfolio allocated to structured finance
- Invests across industries using various structures
- Targets opportunities underserved by regulated capital pools such as banks or NBFCs
- Focuses on regulatory arbitrage (flexibility and equity substitution) and investor herding opportunities
- Example deal: Mid-corporate sponsor-funding for a waste-processing company run by an IIT Bombay graduate, with promoter acquiring PE stake (IFC), IRR around 18%

### 2. Financials (NBFCs)
- 20-30% of portfolio allocated to financials
- Target profitable, retail-focused, mid-sized NBFCs with:
  - Low leverage (<3.5x)
  - High CAR (>20%)
  - Investment-grade ratings
- Focus on templated NBFCs with stability and consistent returns
- Will avoid unsecured portfolio, add only secured NBFCs
- Current environment different from 2018 NBFC crisis (better capitalization, improved ALM, supportive policy)
- Example deal: Pune-based rural financier with 70% rural housing business, 30% unsecured, managed by ICICI Bank veterans, rated BBB, leverage <1x, expected yield 14-15%

### 3. Real Estate
- Approximately 20% of portfolio
- Adds uncorrelated risks for portfolio diversification
- Benefits from current macro tailwinds: low inventory, rising prices, industry consolidation
- Developer finance market size: ₹150,000 crore, with ₹115,000 crore in non-LRD funding across top 8 cities
- Focus on approval-stage finance with yields of 17-20%
- Target mid-sized projects (1-5 lakh sq. ft.) executable within 3-4 years
- Avoid larger projects (>1 million sq. ft.) requiring 5-7 years
- Ensure minimum 2x land and cash flow cover
- Control cash flows via escrow accounts
- Target mid-sized developers with proven track records, independent of political affiliations
- Post-RERA improvements: better regulation, reduced builder discretion, improved cash flow management
- Example deal: Navi Mumbai-based developer with 20+ years experience, funding a residential project near Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge Park, IRR above 20%, 2x land cover
